# Mission-First PR Strategy (SpaceX Adoption)

## Core Message
Not about NFTs; about Mars mission acceleration. The public narrative must emphasize verification, contribution alignment, and SpaceX-led trust. Any market mechanisms are optional and appendix-only.

## Do / Don’t List
1. **Do** lead with mission acceleration and verification.
2. **Do** state clearly that there is no land ownership or sovereignty claim.
3. **Do** highlight that SpaceX retains full control of criteria and validation.
4. **Do** emphasize that Layer 1 works without tokens or markets.
5. **Do** position the registry as a standards and accountability tool.
6. **Do** describe community contributions as evidence-based and verifiable.
7. **Do** use language like “reference-only,” “validation,” and “public criteria.”
8. **Do** acknowledge optional appendices only after mission value is proven.
9. **Do** clarify there are no promises of access, flights, or insider data.
10. **Do** reiterate that this is not a fundraising program.
11. **Don’t** frame this as land sale, real estate, or territory claims.
12. **Don’t** imply speculative upside, resale value, or profit potential.
13. **Don’t** use gambling, lottery, or investment language.
14. **Don’t** suggest SpaceX is issuing assets or financial products.
15. **Don’t** claim official partnership unless SpaceX confirms it.
16. **Don’t** cite market size or revenue projections in main messaging.
17. **Don’t** create hype cycles that outpace verification.

## Messaging Architecture
- **Primary:** Mission acceleration through verifiable contributions.
- **Secondary:** Ecosystem hygiene by reducing misinformation and low-signal claims.
- **Tertiary:** Optional mechanisms are appendix-only, not the mission path.

## Approved Terminology

## Response to Common Misinterpretations
