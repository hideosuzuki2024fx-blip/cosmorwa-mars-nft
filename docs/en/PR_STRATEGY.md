# PR Strategy: Preventing Misinterpretation

## Core Framing
- SpaceX is **not** launching rockets for NFTs.
- This is **not** land ownership, real estate, or sovereignty.
- The core product is a **Mars Reference Grid** for scientific and operational clarity.
- Optional monetization is appendix-only and never a launch driver.

## Do / Don’t List (15+)
1. **Do** say “reference IDs” and “coordinate standard.”
2. **Don’t** say “land parcels,” “deeds,” or “property titles.”
3. **Do** emphasize Phase 0 as a standalone stop point.
4. **Don’t** lead with revenue projections or marketplace features.
