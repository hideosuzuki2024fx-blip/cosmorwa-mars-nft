# PR Strategy: Mission-First, Misinterpretation-Safe

## Message Box
**Not about NFTs; about Mars mission acceleration.** The Reference Grid is a technical standard for location clarity and verified contributions. SpaceX is not launching rockets for NFTs and is not selling land.

## Core Framing
- Mission acceleration and validated landing site candidates are the primary value.
- This is **not** land ownership, real estate, or sovereignty.
- The Reference Grid is a technical standard, not a marketplace.
- Monetization is optional and appendix-only.

## Do / Don’t List (Avoid misreads)
1. **Do** say “reference IDs” and “coordinate standard.”
2. **Don’t** say “land parcels,” “deeds,” or “property titles.”
3. **Do** emphasize Phase 0 as a stop point.
4. **Don’t** lead with revenue or market size.
5. **Do** highlight verification and reproducibility.
6. **Don’t** imply investment returns or speculation.
7. **Do** describe external participation as research contribution.
8. **Don’t** compare to real estate markets.
9. **Do** clarify that SpaceX missions are independent of any token.
10. **Don’t** use “buy,” “sell,” or “flip” language in core materials.
11. **Do** keep any incentives in optional appendices.
12. **Don’t** reference gambling or prediction markets.
13. **Do** explain why a shared reference grid reduces ambiguity.
14. **Don’t** imply SpaceX endorsement of external marketplaces.
