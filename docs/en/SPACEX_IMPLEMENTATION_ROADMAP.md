# SpaceX Implementation Roadmap: Mission-First Mars Reference Grid

## Overview
This roadmap prioritizes mission acceleration and operational clarity. Phase 0 is a full stop point that must prove standalone value without any commercial layer. Each phase defines deliverables, required SpaceX inputs, verification methods, and explicit stop/kill criteria. Regulatory and commercialization topics are kept out of the mainline roadmap and, if ever needed, belong only in an optional appendix.

---

## Phase 0: Reference-only (Stop Point)
**Purpose:** Establish a Mars Reference Grid with stable Reference IDs that reduce internal ambiguity.

**Deliverables**
- Reference Grid schema (projection, resolution tiers, ID format)
- Reference ID registry (static dataset or API)
- Documentation and usage guidelines

**Required SpaceX Inputs**
- Alignment on a coordinate standard that SpaceX can endorse
- Minimal internal review by mapping/mission stakeholders

**Verification Methods**
- Internal usage test: multiple teams reference the same site consistently
- External pilot: third parties can label datasets without confusion

**Stop/Kill Criteria**
- If the grid does not reduce ambiguity or speed collaboration, stop here.
- If it introduces operational overhead, stop here.

---

## Phase 1: Contribution & Verification
**Purpose:** Allow external researchers to submit analyses tied to Reference IDs and verify reproducibility.

**Deliverables**
- Contribution specification (data, methods, provenance requirements)
- Verification workflow (independent review, reproducibility checks)
- Lightweight submission portal

**Required SpaceX Inputs**
- Acceptance criteria for verified outputs
- Light-touch feedback on verification thresholds

**Verification Methods**
- Independent reproduction of submitted analyses
- Multi-source validation where possible

**Stop/Kill Criteria**
- If verification burden exceeds mission value, pause or stop.
- If submissions create reputational risk or confusion, stop here.

---

## Phase 2: Scaled Integration
**Purpose:** Integrate verified external datasets into SpaceX workflows when useful.

**Deliverables**
- Internal ingestion guidance for verified datasets
- Reference ID usage guidance for public communications (optional)
- Updates to internal documentation

**Required SpaceX Inputs**
- Small internal working group for evaluation
- Approval for limited public reference ID usage (optional)

**Verification Methods**
- Operational review of time saved and clarity gained
- Quality audits on accepted datasets

**Stop/Kill Criteria**
- If integration does not improve mission iteration, revert.
- If public misunderstanding increases, reduce external visibility.

---

## Phase 3: Optional Expansion (Non-essential)
**Purpose:** Optional ecosystem partnerships for broader adoption.

**Deliverables**
- Partner usage guidelines
- Expanded validation network

**Required SpaceX Inputs**
- Policy review for external partnerships
- Light program oversight

**Verification Methods**
- Partner compliance audits
- Periodic quality reviews

**Stop/Kill Criteria**
- If partner misuse harms reputation, terminate partnerships.
- If risk increases without mission value, pause or stop.

## Optional Appendix (Non-committal)
If SpaceX ever requests it, an optional appendix can document non-binding considerations such as compliance review or funding models. These are outside the core roadmap and do not drive mission decisions.
