# SpaceX Outreach Strategy (Mission-First Adoption)

## Objectives
- Secure Phase 0 adoption for the Reference Grid as a mission-accelerating standard.
- Prevent misinterpretation by centering mission value and rejecting land-sale narratives.
- Align all outreach with PR guardrails and the 3-layer model.

## Target Pathways
1. **Direct executive outreach** through mission and engineering leadership.
2. **Partner introductions** via aerospace, geospatial, and academic networks.
3. **Research collaborations** with planetary science and mapping groups.
4. **Events and convenings** focused on space operations and standards.

## Action Plan (Specific Actions)
1. Produce a one-page mission-first brief emphasizing Phase 0 stop point.
2. Request warm introductions through trusted aerospace advisors.
3. Publish a technical explainer on Reference Grid standards and mission value.
4. Present a short talk at geospatial or planetary science events.
5. Host a closed workshop on verification workflows and reproducibility.
6. Provide a demo dataset labeled with Reference IDs for peer review.
7. Run a small pilot with external researchers to validate the grid.
8. Coordinate pre-approved language with PR to avoid ownership framing.
9. Offer a neutral technical Q&A package for SpaceX stakeholders.
10. Engage standards bodies or research consortia for feedback.
11. Convene an expert roundtable on landing site candidate validation.
12. Create a misinterpretation checklist for all external communications.

## Alignment with PR Strategy
- Every outreach asset states: “Not about NFTs; about Mars mission acceleration.”
- No land ownership, real estate, or sovereignty language.
- Monetization appears only in optional appendices and never in initial outreach.

## Expected Outcomes
- Clear decision on Phase 0 adoption.
- Improved alignment on Reference Grid parameters.
- Reduced reputational risk through consistent messaging.
