# Mission-First Outreach Strategy (SpaceX Adoption)

## Purpose
Engage mission-aligned communities with a clear, verification-first message that avoids speculation and land-sale framing. All outreach must reinforce SpaceX as the trust anchor and keep optional market mechanisms in an appendix only.

## Concrete Actions (10+)
1. Publish a public mission-aligned contribution call with verification criteria.
2. Host a technical webinar focused on how to submit verifiable evidence.
3. Provide a public FAQ that addresses misinterpretations directly.
4. Establish a lightweight submission template for evidence packages.
5. Engage university labs for mission-relevant validation pilots.
6. Coordinate with open-source aerospace communities for standards alignment.
7. Build a public registry page listing verified contributions.
8. Offer office-hour sessions for clarification on criteria.
9. Collaborate with Mars-focused nonprofits to amplify guardrails.
10. Publish periodic updates highlighting verified contributions only.
11. Create a press kit centered on mission acceleration and verification.
12. Brief science media on the non-ownership, non-NFT mission framing.

## Outreach Pathways
- **Academic:** Labs, research groups, student teams.
- **Industry:** Aerospace suppliers, simulation tool providers, robotics teams.
- **Open-source:** Mission-relevant software and hardware communities.
- **Public Education:** Museums, science communicators, STEM programs.

## Guardrails for All Outreach
- Avoid language that implies ownership, land, or investment.
- Do not announce market mechanisms outside the appendix.
- Keep SpaceX control and verification authority explicit.
- Focus on evidence and validation rather than hype or speculation.
