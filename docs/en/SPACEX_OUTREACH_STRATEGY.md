# SpaceX Outreach Strategy (Adoption-Ready)

## Objectives
- Secure SpaceX engagement for Phase 0 (Reference-only) approval.
- Avoid misinterpretation by emphasizing non-ownership and non-speculative framing.
- Align outreach with PR guardrails and messaging discipline.

## Target Pathways
1. **Direct executive outreach** (business development and mission leadership).
2. **Partner introductions** (trusted aerospace/academic partners).
3. **Research collaborations** (scientific and mapping communities).
4. **Events and convenings** (space policy, geospatial, and scientific conferences).

## Action Plan (10+ Specific Actions)
1. Create a one-page executive brief that highlights Layer 1 and Phase 0 stop point.
2. Request warm introductions through aerospace advisors or alumni of SpaceX programs.
3. Publish a technical blog post describing the Reference Grid as a neutral standard.
4. Present a lightning talk at a geospatial or planetary science conference.
5. Host a closed-door workshop with researchers on reference ID standards.
6. Engage with partner organizations (universities, labs) to test grid usage.
7. Provide a demo dataset labeled with Reference IDs for peer review.
8. Coordinate with PR to pre-clear language that avoids ownership or NFT framing.
9. Offer a pilot collaboration with SpaceX open data teams (if available).
10. Submit a short technical note to a relevant space standards body.
11. Conduct a small advisory roundtable with external experts on verification methods.
12. Provide SpaceX with a “misinterpretation guardrails” checklist for internal use.

## Alignment with PR Strategy
- Every outreach asset must explicitly state: “SpaceX is not launching rockets for NFTs” and “This is not land ownership.”
- Any monetization references are isolated to appendices or optional follow-ups.
- Use “reference grid,” “reference IDs,” and “coordinate standard” as primary terms.

## Expected Outcomes
- Clear decision on Phase 0 adoption.
- Feedback from SpaceX on reference grid parameters.
- Reduced reputational risk by pre-emptive messaging discipline.
