# SpaceX Mission-First Implementation Roadmap

## Overview
This roadmap defines a phased, mission-first adoption path centered on verifiable contributions. It starts with a reference-only Phase 0 stop point and scales only if SpaceX confirms mission value. Monetization is excluded from the main phases and reserved for an optional appendix.

## Phase 0: Reference-Only STOP POINT
**Purpose:** Validate the concept with minimal commitment.

**Deliverables**
- Publish a short list of mission-aligned contribution categories.
- Publish verification criteria and evidence requirements for each category.
- Stand up a simple registry structure to record verified contributions.

**Required SpaceX Inputs**
- Approval of the contribution categories list.
- Approval of verification criteria language.
- A single point of contact for clarifications.

**Verification**
- Criteria and registry format are publicly available.
- At least one category includes a clear, testable evidence checklist.

**Stop Conditions (Kill/Stop)**
- If criteria cannot be agreed or create reputational risk, stop.
- If the registry creates confusion about ownership or speculation, stop.
- If SpaceX determines the effort does not aid mission velocity, stop.

## Phase 1: Pilot Validation
**Deliverables**
- Accept a small set of submissions in one or more categories.
- Verify submissions using published criteria.
- Publish acknowledgements for verified contributions.

**Required SpaceX Inputs**
- Review or designate a verifier for pilot submissions.
- Confirm acknowledgment language.

**Verification**
- Pilot submissions are processed using the published checklist.
- Feedback loop is documented to improve criteria.

**Stop Conditions**
- If submissions create more noise than signal, stop.
- If verification creates undue operational burden, stop.

## Phase 2: Scale Coordination
**Deliverables**
- Expand categories and refine criteria based on pilot results.
- Introduce optional coordination templates for consistent submissions.
- Publish a cadence for review and acknowledgment updates.

**Required SpaceX Inputs**
- Approve expanded categories and revised criteria.
- Approve cadence and publication format.

**Verification**
- Demonstrated reduction in low-signal submissions.
- Improved clarity in contribution evidence standards.

**Stop Conditions**
- If scaled coordination introduces misinterpretation risks, stop.
- If resource load exceeds agreed limits, stop.

## Phase 3: Ecosystem Integration (Optional)
**Deliverables**
- Formalize partnerships with aligned external organizations.
- Establish long-term governance for criteria updates.
- Create a stable, mission-aligned repository of verified contributions.

**Required SpaceX Inputs**
- Approval of partner criteria and governance rules.
- Appointment of a steward or advisor for registry integrity.

**Verification**
- Consistent adherence to criteria across partners.
- Clear evidence that verified contributions support mission needs.

**Stop Conditions**
- If partners diverge from mission priorities, stop.
- If governance weakens trust or clarity, stop.

## Appendix: Optional Monetization (Non-Required)
Any monetization concepts are strictly optional and must not affect the mission-first phases. They are excluded from the roadmap unless SpaceX requests an exploratory appendix after Phase 1 proves mission value.
