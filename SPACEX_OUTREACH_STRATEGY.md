## Risk Mitigation

**Risk: SpaceX ignores outreach**
Mitigation: Build sufficient media attention and community validation that SpaceX feels compelled to respond. Leverage industry connections and influencers to amplify message.

**Risk: Competitor copies the idea**
Mitigation: Move quickly to secure media coverage and community validation. GitHub timestamp provides proof of concept creation date.

**Risk: SpaceX develops similar concept internally**
Mitigation: Emphasize the value of external perspective and market validation. Highlight the advisor's ongoing value in execution.

**Risk: Regulatory issues delay implementation**
Mitigation: Prepare comprehensive legal analysis and regulatory strategy in advance. Engage experienced space law attorneys.
